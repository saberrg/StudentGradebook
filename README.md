# Gradebook Excel Creator 

A C++ program built for a user to input student grades in a command line and then creates an excel sheet with the inputted grades along with the each student's grade average and letter grade.

The user controls the number of students and number of assignments given per student

The grading system is a system from A to F, 100 to <70.

I am open to feedback. I want to expand the header file to include student names and grades to make it more secure for the user.
